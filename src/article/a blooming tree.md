>### A Blooming(开花) Tree
>May Buddha(佛坨) let us meet    
in my most beautiful hours    
I have prayed it    
for five hundred years    
Buddha made me a tree    
by the path you may take    
In full blossoms I'm wait in the sun    
every flowers carrying my previous hope    
as you are near, listen carefully   
the quivering(颤抖的) leaves are my waiting zeal(热情)   
as you pass by the tree  
without noticing me  
My friend, upon the ground behind you is not the fallen petals(花瓣)  
but my withered(/ˈwɪðəd/ 凋零、枯萎的) heart.
